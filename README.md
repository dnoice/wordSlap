 * [cite_start]Frequency Analysis: Provides detailed statistics on word frequency. [cite: 8]
üî¨ Advanced Linguistic Insights
 * [cite_start]Linguistic Feature Detection: Identifies interesting properties like palindromes, words with rare letters (j, k, q, x, z), prefixes, suffixes, and euphonious (pleasant-sounding) words. [cite: 41, 42, 44, 46]
 * [cite_start]Word Clustering: Generates cluster visualizations based on word length and syllable count for advanced pattern detection. [cite: 170]
üöÄ Performance & Efficiency
 * [cite_start]Parallel Processing: Blazes through large word lists by using multiple CPU cores. [cite: 6, 67]
